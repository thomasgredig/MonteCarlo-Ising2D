 Monte Carlo simulation of Ising 2D model in R
 

## Ising 2D Model

The Ising2D model is initialized as follows:

After a bit of Monte Carlo, a domain pattern emerges at low enough temperatures:

Repeating this procedure over a range of temperatures and waiting for convergence, one finds the phase transition where domains can form:
